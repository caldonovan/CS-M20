  abstract  = {Satisfiability (SAT) is considered as one of the most important core technologies in formal verification and related areas. Even though there is steady progress in improving practical SAT solving, there are limits on scalability of SAT solvers. We address this issue and present a new approach, called cube-and-conquer, targeted at reducing solving time on hard instances. This two-phase approach partitions a problem into many thousands (or millions) of cubes using lookahead techniques. Afterwards, a conflict-driven solver tackles the problem, using the cubes to guide the search. On several hard competition benchmarks, our hybrid approach outperforms both lookahead and conflict-driven solvers. Moreover, because cube-and-conquer is natural to parallelize, it is a competitive alternative for solving SAT problems in parallel.},

  abstract  = {In this work, our objective is to study the impact of knowledge sharing on the performance of portfolio-based parallel local search algorithms. Our work is motivated by the demonstrated importance of clause-sharing in the performance of complete parallel SAT solvers. Unlike complete solvers, state-of-the-art local search algorithms for SAT are not able to generate redundant clauses during their execution. In our settings, each member of the portfolio shares its best configuration (i.e., one which minimizes conflicting clauses) in a common structure. At each restart point, instead of classically generating a random configuration to start with, each algorithm aggregates the shared knowledge to carefully craft a new starting point. We present several aggregation strategies and evaluate them on a large set of problems.},
