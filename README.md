Swansea University final year dissertation for Advanced Software Technology.

> Very much a work in progress...

## Subject
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the methods in which SAT solvers can be implemented within software.
We then measure the performance of this SAT solver against other FOSS solvers. And discuss methods in which performance
can be improved using well known methods.
